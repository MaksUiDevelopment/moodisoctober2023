                           are not targeting civilians in Gaza. However, it
                           cannot be denied that IDF airstrikes are causing harm to the civilian population in Gaza,
                           with half of them being
                           children. The airstrikes destroy homes and result in the death and injury of civilians. Is
                           all of the above not
                           considered a war crime? Let's delve into it.

                           The International Criminal Court has only existed for a few decades, with the aim of
                           prosecuting war crimes. Currently,
                           there are no credible reports that the Israel Defense Forces are intentionally attacking the
                           civilian population. The
                           legal definition of a war crime depends on intent. By answering a simple question, we can
                           understand whether Israel has
                           committed a war crime:
                           <span class="highligted">
                              <br><br>
                              Is the purpose of the attack to kill civilians?
                              <br><br>
                              1. Yes<br>
                              2. No
                              <br><br>
                           </span>
                           If the answer is "no," then Israel's airstrikes cannot be labeled as a war crime. We know the
                           answer because the IDF has
                           repeatedly declared its intentions."

                     <div class="sprf__text">The next alleged war crime committed by Israel is the use of
                        disproportionate force. It
                        appears to be a war crime, doesn't it? Even if Israel does not intentionally target civilians,
                        it is challenging
                        to deny the number of casualties. We know that around 1400 people have died on the Israeli side,
                        while the Gaza
                        Ministry of Health reports significantly higher numbers on the Gaza side. It sounds official and
                        lawful, but we
                        are aware that Gaza is controlled by HAMAS, the Minister of Health in Gaza is affiliated with
                        HAMAS—the same HAMAS
                        that kills Israel's civilians. Therefore, we should not take their numbers at face value.
                        <br><br>
                        But let's momentarily assume that there are honest and kind people in Gaza's healthcare system,
                        and their numbers
                        are accurate. The figures they provide are high, around 10,000, while Israel's casualties are
                        ≈1400. Does this
                        align with the legal definition of a war crime?
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to proportionality, it's not about revenge or killing an equal number of
                        civilians. In other words,
                        it's not "an eye for an eye," not about committing exactly the same actions or even in the
                        number of bodies. When
                        you judge the appropriateness of an attack based on the number of casualties, you are not
                        protecting civilians;
                        you are incentivizing the use of human shields.
                        <br><br>
                        HAMAS is indeed adept at public relations. They know they have a "compelling narrative." The
                        more civilians die,
                        the more they can say, "Hey, we have the right to attack Israel," and that's why they have an
                        incentive to use
                        women and children as human shields. The more civilian casualties, the more legitimate HAMAS
                        appears. It's harsh,
                        but it's the truth. It was in their plans on October 7th, evident from where they store weapons
                        and where attacks
                        originate (from residential buildings and densely populated areas).
                        <br><br>
                        There's a good analogy: if you're trying to eliminate a sniper in a mission, you can't level an
                        entire city, but
                        you can destroy a building, even if there are civilians inside. The same goes for HAMAS leaders;
                        it would be
                        proportionate to destroy a residential building to eliminate a HAMAS leader. The most
                        challenging part here is the
                        lack of numbers, lack of ratios, and this means that for those making such decisions, it's not
                        easy.

                     <div class="tprf__text">The most challenging part remains: does Israel prevent Palestinians in the
                        Gaza Strip from receiving humanitarian aid?
                        It sounds serious, but does Israel fit the legal definition of this war crime? We know that
                        immediately after the start
                        of the war, Israel cut off electricity, water, and internet. While these actions may be directed
                        against Hamas, they
                        also harm innocent civilians. The residents of Gaza already suffer from a lack of adequate
                        infrastructure and food
                        independence. They lack proper sewage, sufficient electricity, and easy access to clean water.
                        For the past 17 years,
                        Hamas has spent its resources on acquiring rockets and weapons instead of modernizing sewage
                        systems, improving living
                        standards, and building new water purification and power facilities. Worse still, they have
                        stolen crucial resources
                        needed to operate the internal power station. So, is this blockade a war crime? A blockade or
                        siege like the one in Gaza
                        is not prohibited by international law. Of course, the law has humanitarian aspects, right? Such
                        as the transportation
                        of necessary fuel, food, and medicine to peaceful civilians across the border. But this is only
                        applicable when they can
                        be reliably delivered without redirecting them to the enemy. About a month ago, the UN confirmed
                        that Hamas had stolen
                        these shipments. Therefore, the answer to the first question posed in this paragraph is no;
                        Israel did not commit such a
                        war crime.</div>
