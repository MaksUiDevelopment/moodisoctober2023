                        <div class="fprf__text">"The Israel Defense Forces have repeatedly stated that their airstrikes
                           are not targeting civilians in Gaza. However, it
                           cannot be denied that IDF airstrikes are causing harm to the civilian population in Gaza,
                           with half of them being
                           children. The airstrikes destroy homes and result in the death and injury of civilians. Is
                           all of the above not
                           considered a war crime? Let's delve into it.

                           The International Criminal Court has only existed for a few decades, with the aim of
                           prosecuting war crimes. Currently,
                           there are no credible reports that the Israel Defense Forces are intentionally attacking the
                           civilian population. The
                           legal definition of a war crime depends on intent. By answering a simple question, we can
                           understand whether Israel has
                           committed a war crime:
                           <span class="highligted">
                              <br><br>
                              Is the purpose of the attack to kill civilians?
                              <br><br>
                              1. Yes<br>
                              2. No
                              <br><br>
                           </span>
                           If the answer is "no," then Israel's airstrikes cannot be labeled as a war crime. We know the
                           answer because the IDF has
                           repeatedly declared its intentions."

                           The next alleged <span class="highligted td-tt">crime</span> committed by Israel is the use
                           of
                           <span class="highligted td-tt">disproportionate</span> force. Sounds like a war <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">crime</span>, doesn't it? Even if Israel does not intentionally
                           attack civilians, it's
                           hard to deny the number of <span class="highligted td-tt">casualties</span>. We know that
                           around 1400 people <span class="highligted td-tt">died</span> on the Israeli side, while on
                           the Gaza side, according to the Ministry of
                           <span class="highligted td-tt">Health</span> of Gaza, the number is several times <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">higher</span>. It sounds official and legal, but we know that
                           Gaza is controlled by
                           HAMAS, and the Minister of <span class="highligted td-tt">Health</span> in Gaza is HAMAS as
                           well, the same HAMAS
                           that kills Israeli civilians. So, we shouldn't take their numbers at face value. But let's,
                           for a moment, assume
                           that there are honest and kind people in the Gaza <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">healthcare</span> system, and
                           their numbers are accurate. The figures they provide are high, around 10,000, while on the
                           Israeli side, it's
                           ≈1400. Does this meet the legal definition of a war <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">crime</span>?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           When it comes to <span class="highligted td-tt">proportionality</span>, it's not about
                           revenge, not about finding
                           X killed and killing an equal number of civilians. In other words, it's not about "an eye for
                           an eye," not about
                           committing exactly the same actions, not even in terms of the number of bodies. When you
                           judge the appropriateness
                           of an attack based on the number of <span class="highligted td-tt">casualties</span>, you are
                           not protecting
                           civilians; you are encouraging the use of human shields.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           HAMAS is really good at PR. They know they have a "compelling story." The more civilian <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">deaths</span>, the <span class="highligted td-tt">more</span>
                           they can say: "Hey, we
                           have the right to attack Israel," and that's why they have an incentive to use women and
                           children as human
                           shields. The <span class="highligted td-tt">more</span> civilian <span
                              class="highligted td-tt">deaths</span>, the
                           <span class="highligted td-tt">more</span> legitimate HAMAS looks. It's crude, but it's true.
                           It was part of their
                           plan on October 7th. And it's evident from where they store weapons and where they launch
                           attacks (from
                           residential buildings and densely populated areas).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           There's a good example: you try to eliminate a sniper in a mission; you can't level an entire
                           city, but you can
                           destroy a building even if there are civilians. The challenge here is the absence of numbers,
                           the absence of
                           ratios, and this means that for those who make such decisions, it's not easy at all.

                     <div class="tprf__title">Did Israel create a humanitarian catastrophe?</div>
                     <div class="tprf__text">The most challenging part remains: does Israel prevent Palestinians in the
                        Gaza Strip from receiving humanitarian aid?
                        It sounds serious, but does Israel fit the legal definition of this war crime? We know that
                        immediately after the start
                        of the war, Israel cut off electricity, water, and internet. While these actions may be directed
                        against Hamas, they
                        also harm innocent civilians. The residents of Gaza already suffer from a lack of adequate
                        infrastructure and food
                        independence. They lack proper sewage, sufficient electricity, and easy access to clean water.
                        For the past 17 years,
                        Hamas has spent its resources on acquiring rockets and weapons instead of modernizing sewage
                        systems, improving living
                        standards, and building new water purification and power facilities. Worse still, they have
                        stolen crucial resources
                        needed to operate the internal power station. So, is this blockade a war crime? A blockade or
                        siege like the one in Gaza
                        is not prohibited by international law. Of course, the law has humanitarian aspects, right? Such
                        as the transportation
                        of necessary fuel, food, and medicine to peaceful civilians across the border. But this is only
                        applicable when they can
                        be reliably delivered without redirecting them to the enemy. About a month ago, the UN confirmed
                        that Hamas had stolen
                        these shipments. Therefore, the answer to the first question posed in this paragraph is no;
                        Israel did not commit such a
                        war crime.</div>
